# US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project for Udacity Nanodegree

## Date Created
6th Sep 21

## Description
In this project, we wrote a `code` that takes in raw `input` to create an _interactive experience_ in the terminal to compare a variety of **_descriptive statistics_** of the **bike-share** system usage between three large cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-sharing system provider for many major cities in the United States.


## Statistics Computed
this project provides the following information:
1- **Popular times of travel** (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

 - most common month
 - most common day of week
 - most common hour of day


2- **Popular stations and trip**

 - most common start station
 - most common end station
 - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)


3- **Trip duration**

 - total travel time
 - average travel time


4- **User info**

 - counts of each user type 
 - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
 - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


## Project Data
- chicago.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.
