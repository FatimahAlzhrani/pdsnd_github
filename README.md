# US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project for Udacity Nanodegree

## Date Created
6th Sep 21

## Description
In this project, we wrote a `code` that takes in raw `input` to create an _interactive experience_ in the terminal to compare a variety of **_descriptive statistics_** of the **bike-share** system usage between three large cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-sharing system provider for many major cities in the United States.


## Project Data
- chicago.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

- new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.

- washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. 
	_Note_: washington.csv does not include the _'Gender'_ or _'Birth Year'_ data.


## Softwares Needed
- Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda.
